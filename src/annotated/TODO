TODO for typed uScheme
======================

Major change: `define` syntax has to be redone to correspond to Ramsey's syntax.
Need `val` and `val-rec` forms.  Even the abstract syntax needs to be fixed.

Change `scheme_type` to `type_expr` or something non-language-specific.

Check for keywords and reserved ids.  Partially implemented.

Make built-in type names and type constructor names into reserved ids.

Add main.ml.  Fix run_tests.py.  Allow command-line arguments.

Fix environments.

Add "val" form.  Fix syntax.

Get rid of "Narrow".  What should it be?  ApplyType?
