# CS81 2019 - myth language attempt 1

## Resources
- [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)
  - A similar idea. A type-safe Ruby-like language that compiles to C.
- [Type-Systems](https://github.com/tomprimozic/type-systems)
  - Several type systems implemented im OCaml.
- [Airtight](https://github.com/alehander42/Airtight)
  - A potentially useful toy language. Python 3 with hindley-milner.


### Ideology
We want a lot of interfaces so "duck typing" is as feasible as possible
while still being type safe.

### Four Fundamental Declarations of Kinds
- Enums
  - Like Rust's enums
- Classes
  - Like Python's classes
- Traits
  - Like Haskell's typeclasses
- Functions
